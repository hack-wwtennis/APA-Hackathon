# APA-Hackathon
Code for data science project at the APA Hackaton 2018

Built a neural network predictor for the Parvo disease given data in the following steps:
1. Cleanse the data
2. Manually look at the column values for if the data can be used, and how (NaNs, binary, classification, real normalization)
3. Read the data into a data frame in a suitable format for the specific columns
4. Run a TensorFlow neural network on the data
